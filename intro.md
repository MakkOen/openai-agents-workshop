This workshop will teach you the basics of using OpenAI API to query Large Language Models. We will be using OpenAI's models for demonstration purposes but 
OpenAI API can be used to access any opensource LLM.

After we learn the basics of OpenAI API we will learn how to equip LLMs with our own python functions and control their workflow.
