## OpenAI API Intro

[OpenAI Python API library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)

An open source python library for convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.8+ application.

Very easy to use and commonly used by providers and applications, not just OpenAI. You can setup even your own local LLMs and access them through the OpenAI API.
